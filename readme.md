##Converting Excel to JSON

I installed a npm package called xls-to-json. Following the instructions on the package, I created a javascript file app.js that converted the excel file to JSON file. 

## Creating a JSON file for each author
I created a file json_writer.py that first creates a dictionary of all the keys in the Key spreadsheet with the descriptions as values. I then converted the keys in the JSON file to the description. Then, I generated a JSON file for each JSON object corresponding to each author in the JSON file I created before.
